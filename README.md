# Horiseon Challenge Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to create a webpage using basic principles of HTML, CSS, and Git. Using what I've learned through the first week, I've created a webpage that follows accessibility standards, uses various selectors and other html elements, also implementing many CSS design styles. In the final part of this challenge, I implemented a public webpage from my github repository.

## Usage

This webpage is intended to be optimized for search engines through the implementation of accessibility standards.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/02_Challenge_image.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
